<h1>Network File Shares and Permissions</h1>
This walkthrough will build intuition for network file shares and permissions after the installation of our last Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services lab.  
<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop (Microsoft Remote Access in the App Store for MAC users)
- Active Directory Domain Services

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows Server 2022</b> (21H2)
- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Create some sample file shares with various permissions</h2>

- Connect/log into DC-1 as your domain admin account (mydomain.com\jane_admin)
- Connect/log into Client-1 as a normal user (mydomain\<someuser>)
- On DC-1, on the C:\ drive, create 4 folders: “read-access”, “write-access”, “no-access”, “accounting”
- Set the following permissions (share the folder) for the “Domain Users” group:
- Folder: “read-access”, Group: “Domain Users”, Permission: “Read”
- Folder: “write-access”,  Group: “Domain Users”, Permissions: “Read/Write”
- Folder: “no-access”, Group: “Domain Admins”, “Permissions: “Read/Write”
- (Skip accounting for now)

<h2>Attempt to access file shares as a normal user</h2>

- On Client-1, navigate to the shared folder (start, run, \\dc-1)
- Try to access the folders you just created. Which folders can you access? Which folders can you create stuff in? Does it make sense?

<h2>Create an “ACCOUNTANTS” Security Group, assign permissions, an test access</h2>

- Go back to DC-1, in Active Directory, create a security group called “ACCOUNTANTS”
- On the “accounting” folder you created earlier, set the following permissions:
- Folder: “accounting”, Group: “ACCOUNTANTS”, Permissions: “Read/Write”
- On Client-1, as  <someuser>, try to access the accountants folder. It should fail. 
- Log out of Client-1 as  <someuser>
- On DC-1, make <someuser> a member of the “ACCOUNTANTS”  Security Group
- Sign back into Client-1 as <someuser> and try to access the “accounting” share in \\DC-1\ - Does it work now?
